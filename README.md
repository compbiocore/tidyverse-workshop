# Tidyverse Workshops

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for a workshop and minor variants developed by the [Computational Biology Core](http://cbc.brown.edu/) around tidying, transforming and visualizing data in R with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

The primary workshop, 'Visualization in R with tidyverse', is designed to expand upon the [Fundamentals of R](https://compbiocore.github.io/r-workshop-1/) workshop; it is a basic-level lecture that presupposes some knowledge of R like that found in our 'Fundamentals of R' workshop. The notebook for that workshop can be [viewed in Markdown](https://compbiocore.github.io/tidyverse-workshop/workshop/) or on [nbViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/compbiocore/tidyverse-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/workshop.ipynb).
